# 💳 Payment System (Polymorphism in Python)

A beginner-friendly Python project that demonstrates **polymorphism** in Object-Oriented Programming by implementing multiple payment methods with a shared interface.

---

## 📖 Description

The Payment System models real-world payment methods using a common `Payment` base class.  
Different payment types such as **Cash**, **Card**, and **UPI** implement the same `pay()` method but behave differently at runtime.

This project clearly shows how polymorphism allows the same method call to produce different outcomes depending on the object type.
