# 🚗 Vehicle System (Inheritance in Python)

A simple and beginner-friendly Python project that demonstrates **inheritance** using a real-world vehicle example.  
This project shows how child classes can reuse and extend the behavior of a parent class using Object-Oriented Programming.

---

## 📖 Description

The Vehicle System is built around a base `Vehicle` class that contains common attributes such as speed and fuel type.  
Two child classes, `Car` and `Bike`, inherit from this parent class and introduce their own unique behaviors.

This project is ideal for understanding how inheritance helps reduce code duplication and improves structure.
